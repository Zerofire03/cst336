                <p>Anyone that has ever had a windows machine knows that every month, Microsoft is
                going to release patches to it. These patches always seem to want to install at the wrong
                time, and can cause nothing but headaches for users. With <abbr title="System Center Configuration Manager">SCCM</abbr>
                administrators can configure exactly which updates are deployed, when the updates go out,
                and to specific users and computers even. This allows for the administrator to test
                the updates in a controlled enviorment to see if it breaks any applications or OS features,
                as well as provide a benefit for the user. Users do not have to worry about installing updates,
                and with <abbr title="System Center Configuration Manager">SCCM</abbr>, specific windows
                can be specified to install updates; meaning no please wait while updates are installed 
                messages when a user comes in.</p>
