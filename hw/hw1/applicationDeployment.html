                <p>In an enterprise enviornment, users are not generally allowed to be able to install software 
                on their machine. This is for many reasons. A few of these reasons are listed below:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span>Security</span>: Users are not given administrative rights</li>
                    <li><span>Licenses</span>: IT department needs to make sure software is licensed</li>
                    <li><span>Auditing</span>: The IT department needs to know what is installed where</li>

                <p><abbr title="System Center Configuration Manager">SCCM</abbr> allows for users to be able to install 
                preapproved applications on their machines themselves. The IT department is able to control which 
                applications are availible to users, make sure a valid license is purchased for the software,
                and are able to monitor and track where the software itself is installed. </p>
