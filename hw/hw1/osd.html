                <p>An <abbr title="Operating System Deployment">OSD</abbr> is what is used to deploy a new entire operating system to a machine. This can
                be either a brand new machine that needs to have an operating system put on it, or it can be a machine that needs to be upgraded to the latest
                operating system. A well configured and fine tuned <abbr title="Operating System Deployment">OSD</abbr> makes a very hands off approach to 
                deploying operating systems to machines. Not only are you able to deploy operating systems, you are able to fully customize the operating system 
                to how you need it, as well as include all the applications that you're company requires for you to have on a machine. These 
                <abbr title="Operating System Deployment">OSD's</abbr> make it very easy for an administrator to have consistency, as well as a hands off approach
                to the process.</p>
