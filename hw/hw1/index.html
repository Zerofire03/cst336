                <h3>Brief History</h3>
                <p><abbr title="System Center Configuration Manager">SCCM</abbr> can trace it's roots back to Systems Management Server that was first published back in 1994. This version was to be used on MS-DOS
                Windows NT, and MacOS. The 2007 version of the product was the first year to use the name System Center Configuration Manager. Up until the
                year 2015, there was a new major version released about the time of each major Windows kernel update. Starting in 2015 the software is no longer
                released with a year anymore. It is now considered a Current Branch with a build number. The developers have moved to a much more rapid release 
                cycle with multiple major versions of the software coming out each year; as many as 4 in one year.</p><details><summary>For a more detailed history, please visit<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_System_Center_Configuration_Manager">[1]</a></summary></details>
